I have an interest in developing Bioconductor packages. I am currently the maintainer of [scMerge](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scMerge.html). I am thinking about working towards integrating `tidyverse` concepts with S4-class objects in Bioconductor, e.g. through [plyexperiment](https://github.com/kevinwang09/plyexperiment). 


I think the Bioconductor framework for package management (and by extension, the pursue for reproducibility in research) is invaluable. Thus, I have taken up some extra efforts to learn about the `git` version control system and the package continuous integration tool `travis`. I also use `docker`, which you can read about [here](/project/cloud_computing).
