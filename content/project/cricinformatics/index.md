I always enjoy watching cricket and given that my research is in bioinformatics, I have "created" my own discipline: Cricinformatics (the name has nothing to do with Cricinfo, but I am open to the idea of a sponsorship). 

Cricinformatics aims to use powerful bioinformatics tools to analyse cricket data. I have written a talk on this and all [codes are available](https://github.com/kevinwang09/Cricinformatics) on GitHub.
