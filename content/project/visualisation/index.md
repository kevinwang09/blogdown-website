I like make pretty pictures to explain statistical concepts. This project is very broad but here is a selection of my works to visualise: 

+ [Multi-collinearity](https://kevinwang09.github.io/mcvis/)
+ [Duality between p-values and confidence interval](http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/oneSampleTCI/)
+ [Learning `ggplot2` using the `learnr` package](https://gauss17gon.shinyapps.io/ggplot2_basic_tutorial/)
+ [Visualising Elastic Net (in development)](https://github.com/kevinwang09/visualiseEN)
