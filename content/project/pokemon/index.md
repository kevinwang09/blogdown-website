During my PhD years, I realised that I don't get enough exercise. And given that my research is in bioinformatics, I have a great idea to play Pokemon Go and analyse the data/theory associated with the game. 

I have given [talks](https://github.com/kevinwang09/pokemon_workshop/) on the classical Coupon Collector's Problem in statistics, which can be seen as a basic model for collecting Pokemons.
