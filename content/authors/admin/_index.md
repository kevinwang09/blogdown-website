As a kid, I was always fascinated with detective stories, and how one can make inferences on human behaviours based on simple observations and scientific principles. 

Today, I am a senior bioinformatics scientist at Illumina. In my day-to-day work, I utilise my statistical and data science skills to break down complex biological processes, leading to a greater understanding of human diseases. This understanding ultimately results in the creation of high-impact commercial products that improve patient care, diagnosis and our collective knowledge of human genomics. I am currently serving on the {{< staticref "https://statsoc.org.au/New-South-Wales" "newtab" >}}council{{< /staticref >}} of the NSW branch of the Statistical Society of Australia. 

To me, data is like a static lake of information and data science is using clever strategies to fish actionable insights from that lake. Thus, my broad interest is in applying fit-for-purpose statistical and computational tools to understand complex data and make them tell interesting stories. I am active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KevinWangStats), always posting my analytical adventures and technical tips. I also release some of my analytical work through [GitHub](https://github.com/kevinwang09) and [tidytuesday](https://kevinwang09.github.io/tidytuesday/) webpage.

I hold a PhD in statistics from the University of Sydney and worked as a research associate in 2019 and a statistician at CSL Behring in 2020. Previously, I provided consultation and analytical insights to clinicians/biologists through numerous [collaborative publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ScxpjTgAAAAJ&hl=en). I was a Postgraduate Teaching Fellow at the University of Sydney (2016-2019) and a contributor to the outreach program at the University.
