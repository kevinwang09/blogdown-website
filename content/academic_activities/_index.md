# Workshops {#workshop}

I have hosted numerous workshops for academics and professionals in the past. 

### As a host

I have designed and hosted a series of Cloud-based workshops on the topics of:

+ Single Cell RNA Analytics. Which was hosted at the [University of Sydney](https://github.com/SydneyBioX/SC_CPC_workshop), [Bioinformatics Summer 2019](https://github.com/SydneyBioX/BIS2019_SC) and [Cornell University](https://github.com/SydneyBioX/cornell_sc_workshop). An accompany wiki page is [here](https://github.com/SydneyBioX/SC_CPC_workshop/wiki). 

+ R, RStudio and Tidyverse. Which was hosted at [Bioinformatics Summer 2019](https://github.com/SydneyBioX/tidy2019). 


### As an administrator

+ [HiC analytics at Bioinformatics Summer 2019](https://github.com/ycao6928/testASMI)
+ [Phosphoproteomic data analytics at Bioinformatics Summer 2019](https://github.com/SydneyBioX/BIS2019_PhosR)

### As an instructor

I was an instructor for a [R-workshop](https://garthtarr.github.io/meatR/about.html) for the meat industry in 2017 & 2018.

# Community Services {#community}

I have served on the Council of the Statistical Society of Australia NSW (in 2022) and Victorian Branch (in 2021). I was responsible for managing social media accounts, email communications and organising workshops and network events. 

During my undergraduate and postgraduate studies, I held various positions at the [Sydney University Mathematics Society](https://usydsums.org/) and [Sydney University Statistics Society](https://www.facebook.com/USYDStatSoc/), including the executive President position. I was an active contributor for the outreach programs at the University of Sydney. Since 2014, I have given various talks about mathematics to high school students. My most recent talk can be found here: https://kevinwang09.github.io/brussel_sprouts/.
