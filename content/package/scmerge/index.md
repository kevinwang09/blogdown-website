Single-cell RNA-seq is an exciting new technology that allows us to study cell heterogeneity. However, like most transcriptomics data, multiple scRNA-Seq data cannot be easily combined without adjustments for scaling. `scMerge` uses clever algorithms to group similar cells between multiple datasets to understand the noise structure between them. This noise structure is then removed from these datasets to produce a merged data suitable for other downstream scRNA-Seq data analysis.
